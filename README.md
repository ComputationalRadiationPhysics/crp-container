# About
Container recipes for different projects of the HZDR [Computational Radiation Physics group](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/).

All recipes are written in Python with the [hpccm](https://github.com/NVIDIA/hpc-container-maker) library. Depending on the project, you can easily generate recipes for [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
